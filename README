This is a little idea that I'm kicking around.

Quite often, you work somewhere, and a bunch of people work on the same thing.
There might be a load of different groups, working on different things.

Quite often, a 'thing' ( aka a 'Context' ), can be defined by properties of
the local environment, or some other, manually specified attributes.

If you work on *NIX then these things can be easy to find, and tap into.

InTheHood is a really simply way of seeing who else is working in the same
Context as you.

Requirements:
--------------------

- Python 2.3 or later
- MySQLdb (if you want to use the MySql backend)

Installation:
--------------------

- copy InTheHood/defaults.py somewhere
- edit it (generally, for database type fun)
- setenv $INTHEHOOD_CONFIG_FILE '/where/it/lives.py'
- add InTheHood to your PYTHONPATH
- ./python/hood -h
